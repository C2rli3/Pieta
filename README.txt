This project asks to present two seemingly opposing goals:

1. Display an algorithm that will fill in a black and white shaded outline, - split in css (html) elements, at a randomly set interval.

2. The case-study between random-number generating functions, visual occlusion on a contrasting background, and religious/(societal narratives)

The beginning of this project was to admire the Pieta image by Michaelangelo and later turned into injecting it with data to udnerstand it better in modern context. 


Button 1: Shows Pieta as filled in by squares equally by: 

let ran =  Math.ran(comprehnsible_large number, negated value); 

square_grid.setSize(ran);

palie_paint = (square_grid.size()) = {

let i = 0;

while(i<square_grid.size() -1)
{

reverse_int_is_palindrome(  square_grid.current[i] ) ? square_grid.current[i].color= black : square_grid.current[i].color = white;

i++;
}

}

pali_paint(square_grid.size() );


Button 2 shows: 

ran_paint= (square_grid.size())= {


let i=0;

while(i<square_grid.size() -1)
{

for(let j=0; j<square_grid.size() -1; j++) 
{
let call_back_random_int = Math.ran(- comprehensively_large_int, comprehensively_large_int);

square_grid.current[i].color //somthing about selecting random coordinates for row/column to create boxes (x1,y1,x2,y2) to create grid box on coordinate_plane size of(rand() );

}

i++;
}
}

ran_paint=(square_grid.size());
